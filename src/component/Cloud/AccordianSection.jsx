          <p>The architecture of Docker consists of several key components working together:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Docker Engine:</strong> The Docker Engine is the core runtime that runs and manages containers. It consists of the Docker daemon (dockerd) and the Docker client (docker). </li>
            <li><strong>Docker Images:</strong> Docker images are read-only templates that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. </li>
            <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Containers are lightweight and isolated runtime environments created from Docker images. Each container runs as a separate process on the host machine and has its own isolated filesystem, network interface, and process space. </li>
            <li><strong>Docker Registry:</strong> Docker Registry is a repository that stores Docker images. The default public registry is Docker Hub</li>

            <li><strong>Docker Compose:</strong> Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows developers to define a multi-service application in a declarative YAML file, specifying the services, their configurations, and dependencies. </li>
            <li><strong>Docker Networking:</strong> Docker provides a networking subsystem that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world. By default, each container gets its own unique IP address within a private network created by Docker. </li>
            <li><strong>Docker Volumes:</strong> Docker volumes are used to persist and share data between containers and the host machine. Volumes are directories stored outside the container's filesystem, allowing data to persist even if the container is removed. </li>
          </ol>

          <p>The working of Kubernetes can be understood through the following key steps:</p>

          <ol>

            <li><strong>Defining the desired state:</strong> You define the desired state of your application or services using Kubernetes manifests or configuration files. </li>
            <li><strong>Creating Pods:</strong> A pod is a logical group of one or more containers that are scheduled together on the same host, and created based on manifest of pod.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling Pods:</strong> The Kubernetes scheduler assigns pods to appropriate nodes in the cluster based on resource requirements, constraints, and availability. </li>
            <li><strong>Managing Replicas:</strong> Kubernetes provides the ability to scale applications by managing replicas. </li>
            <li><strong>Service Discovery and Load Balancing:</strong> Kubernetes provides a built-in service discovery mechanism. It assigns a unique IP address and DNS name to each set of pods behind a service. Also automatically load balances the traffic across the pods associated with a service.</li>
            <li><strong>Health Monitoring and Self-healing:</strong> Kubernetes continuously monitors the health and status of the pods. If a pod becomes unhealthy or fails, Kubernetes takes corrective actions to maintain the desired state. </li>
            <li><strong>Updating and Rolling Deployments:</strong> Kubernetes supports rolling updates, allowing you to deploy new versions of your application without downtime. </li>
            <li><strong>Managing Persistent Storage:</strong> Kubernetes provides mechanisms to manage persistent storage for applications. It supports various storage options Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are used to abstract the underlying storage infrastructure. </li>
            <li><strong>Cluster Scaling and High Availability:</strong> Kubernetes supports scaling the cluster itself by adding or removing nodes. This helps in dynamically adjusting the cluster's capacity to handle increased or decreased workload. </li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring, Logging, and Observability:</strong> Kubernetes ecosystem offers various tools and integrations for monitoring and logging the cluster and application metrics. </li>

<p>NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a category of database technologies that provide alternatives to traditional SQL (Structured Query Language) databases. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, and diverse data types, offering flexibility, scalability, and high performance. Here are some key features and offerings of NoSQL database technologies:</p>
<p><strong>Data Model Flexibility:</strong> NoSQL databases offer various data models to accommodate different data types and structures, including:</p>
<p><strong>Document Databases: :</strong> Store and retrieve data in flexible, JSON-like documents (e.g. MongoDB, Couchbase).</p>
<p><strong>Key-Value Stores: :</strong> Use simple key-value pairs for data storage and retrieval (e.g. Redis, Riak).</p>
<p><strong>Wide-Column Stores: </strong>Store data in column families with dynamic columns (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).</p>
<p><strong>Graph Databases: </strong>Represent and query data as nodes, edges, and properties (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).</p>
<p><strong>Scalability: :</strong>  NoSQL databases are built to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle large amounts of data and high read/write workloads. They distribute data across multiple servers, enabling seamless scaling as data grows. </p>
<p><strong>High Performance: :</strong> NoSQL databases are optimized for fast data retrieval and processing. They leverage techniques like in-memory caching, sharding, and parallel processing to achieve high throughput and low latency. </p>
<p><strong>Flexibility in Schema Design: :</strong>  NoSQL databases provide schema flexibility, allowing for agile development and accommodating evolving data structures without requiring predefined schemas. </p>
<p><strong>Distributed and Fault-Tolerant Architecture: :</strong> NoSQL databases are designed for distributed environments, ensuring data replication, fault tolerance, and automatic data recovery in case of node failures. </p>
<p><strong>Support for Big Data Analytics: :</strong> Many NoSQL databases integrate with big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, enabling analytics and complex data processing tasks on large datasets. </p>
<p><strong>Cloud-Native Capabilities: :</strong>  NoSQL databases are well-suited for cloud environments, offering elasticity, scalability, and managed database services as part of cloud platforms. </p>
<p><strong>Developer-Friendly Interfaces: :</strong>  NoSQL databases often provide APIs, libraries, and query languages tailored for specific data models, making it easier for developers to work with the databases. </p>
<p><strong>Use Cases: :</strong>  NoSQL databases are commonly used in various applications and industries, including e-commerce, social media, content management, IoT, real-time analytics, and personalized recommendation systems. </p>
<p>The choice between SQL and NoSQL DBaaS depends on the specific requirements of your application, data model, scalability needs, and the query patterns you anticipate. Consider factors like data structure, transactional consistency, horizontal scalability, and performance characteristics to determine whether a SQL or NoSQL DBaaS solution aligns better with your use case.</p>







  
			  
		<strong>NO SQL Database Managed DB services</strong>
<p>ESDS eNlight cloud services supports and have capability to provide NO SQL database Managed services There are four major types of NoSQL databases emerged: document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases. </p>
	  
			  
		<ul>
			<li>	Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.</li>
<li>Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.</li>
			<li>Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.</li>
<li>Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.</li>
			  </ul>

            <li><strong>The data: </strong> The data can be anything you want to store, from  a simple photo to 500,000 video clips. </li>
            <li><strong>An expandable amount of  metadata:</strong> The metadata is  defined by whoever creates the object storage; it contains contextual information  about what the data is, what it should be used for,  its  confidentiality, or anything else that is relevant to the way in which the data is used. </li>
            <li><strong>A globally unique identifier:</strong> The identifier is an address given to the object in order for the object to be found over a distributed system. This way, itâs possible to find the data without having  to know  the physical location of the data (which could  exist within  different parts of  a  data center or  different parts of  the world). </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="blue-text mt-5">1.2	Benefits</h4>
          <strong> 1.  Scalability</strong>
          <p>Object storage  is  known   for  its  compatibility  with   cloud   computing,  and   thatâs because of  its  unlimited scalability feature.  With  eCOS,  storage  capability will be increased and  decreased automatically and  end  user  does not need to worry  about its scalability. eCOS can handle data growth from  MB to GB and GB to TB without any hassle.</p>
          <strong>2.  Faster Data Retrieval and Better Recovery</strong>
          <p>Each object in the storage environment has its own identifying details, comprised of metadata and  ID number, which the OS reads to retrieve data. Without the need to sift  through file structures,  retrieval is much  faster. Thanks  to the metadata and  ID numbers, users donât  need to know  an  objectâs exact location to retrieve it. Having unrestricted metadata also  allows  storage administrators to implement  their own policies  for  data  preservation, retention  and   deletion. This,  along with  the  way storage nodes are distributed across the structure, makes it easier to reinforce data and create better âdisaster recoveryâ strategies.</p>
          <strong>3.  Cost-effectiveness</strong>
          <p>For organizations that need to store large amounts of data, eCOS solution could  be the  most cost-effective.  Because  it  scales out  much   easier than  other  storage environments, itâs less costly  to store all your data. Plus, if users have a private cloud space, costs can be even lower.  Plus, compared to other systems that are  considered inexpensive  for   these  volumes of   data,  itâs  a  much   more  durable  alternative.</p>
          <strong>4.  Customizable Meta-Data</strong>
          <p>When  it comes to object storage, metadata resides in the objects themselves. There is  no  need to build   databases to associate metadata with   the  objects. Custom metadata can   be   created about an  object  file  based  on  contents,  dates,  user information,  permissions,  etc.   Attributes can  be  changed and   added over   time. Because of custom metadata, object storage is highly searchable. Users  can conduct searches that return a set of files that meet specific criteria, such as what percentage of files  are  of a certain type or created by certain owner. This allows  companies to extract insights from  the big data they possess within their files and identify trends</p>
          <p>Disk [IOPS/TB] automatically improves storage resource utilization. It provides a fair performance between multiple virtual machines running on the same cluster and allows policy-based performance goals to be configured in units of normalized IOPS. Disk [IOPS/TB] manages Disk I/O and prevents VMs from using excess Disk resources, causing Disk I/O bottlenecks. Disk [IOPS/TB] policies set fixed Disk IOPS for every VM to ensure that performance window is observed. </p>

          <p>eNlight Object cloud storage provides read after write consistency where each read-and-write operation is guaranteed to return the most recent version of the data.</p>




          <p>Our object storage is highly resilient, with replication across multiple data centers ensuring exceptional availability and durability</p>
          <p>Hosting websites are supported that use client-side technologies(such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), offer services to speed up the distribution of static and dynamic web content, and provide a storage gateway appliance for seamless integration of on-premises data with the cloud</p>
          <p>Object storage should be replicated across multiple DCâs for better resiliency and should be designed for 99.99% availability and 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability.</p>

        <p>'eNlight Cloud Functions' is a FaaS (Functions as a Service) platform which executes functions as per the demands, eliminating server maintenance needs and costs. eNlight Cloud Functions is based upon Apache OpenWhisk which provides a simple and sophisticated platform to deploy functions.</p>
            <p>Serverless' computing relates to the notion of creating and running applications that do not demand server management. It represents a deployment model at a granular level, where applications are a bundle of one or more functions. We upload them to a platform and then they run, auto-scale, and generate a bill as per the particular demand. The term serverless doesn't actually mean that there are no servers involved. We, of course, need them for the codes to function.</p>
